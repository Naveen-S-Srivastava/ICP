## üìñ Overview
This repository contains my **ICP (Interview/Competitive Programming)** solutions and implementations.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific **day of practice** and includes multiple **Java solutions** to algorithmic problems.  

The goal of this repo is to **organize daily problem-solving progress** and serve as a reference for coding interview preparation.
